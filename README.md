# Capstone Project : Predictive Event Modelling - Propensity to watch a video in the next 2 days

<ul>Problem Statement : 
<li>Segment the audience of a content app based on its userâ€™s propensity to watch a video in the next 2 days.</li>
<li>Our goal is to not only identify users who are likely to convert but also target and convert users who are unlikely to convert. Hence, the features used to create the
model should be actionable by a marketer.</li>
</ul>
